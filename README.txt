# Interview-Questions
Q. What is your biggest failure or regret?

Ans. When I had the chance not taking up the chance to work on backend services side of the application which was in Java. That would have helped to widen my knowledge and experince. This was when a coworker from the backend team had left and there was an opportunity for someone to step in and take the ownership of certain part of the backend services. Later someone else took the ownership and I regret passing up on the chance. Though later I onboarded with the backend services codebase and helped out with smaller tickets and code reviews.
