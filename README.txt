# Interview-Questions
Q. What is your biggest failure or regret?

Ans. When I had the chance I did not taking up working on backend services side of the application which was in Java. 
That would have helped to widen my knowledge and experince. This was when a coworker from the backend team had left 
and there was an window of opportunity for someone to step in and take the ownership of certain part of the backend 
services. I was in two minds as I was liking the UI work I was doing but also wanted to try something new. 
Later someone else took the ownership and I regret passing up on the opportunity. Though later I onboarded 
with the backend services codebase and helped out with smaller tickets and code reviews.

Q. Tell about an experience on a feature, or dealing with an issue? Explain the background, the trouble and how it resolved? 
Reflect on what your learned from it and how that changed your decides going forward?

Ans. I was asked to implement a feature which was very losely scoped and requirements were not clearly defined. 
I was made aware of a certain deadline hence I jumped onto working on the feature without actually understanding or myself defining the scope. 
The feature required me to gain additional knowledge and understanding about certain statistics and math which took additional time. 
After gaining full understaing of the ask, I ended up commiting more than I could finish in the given deadline. 
But as I had commited to it and it was a critical feature, I had to work late hours and weekends to finish the feature implementation in time. 
After reflecting from that experience I made sure that I should first completely understand and defined the scope and requirements before 
committing to finishing it in a certain time.

Q. What is your greatest accomplishment?

Ans. My greatest accomplishment was when I received an "Excellence Award" for being customer centric, identifying the gaps in the tool 
and innovating to fill the gaps. For example our tool did not have a proper customer feedback mechanism or process in place. All our customer 
feedback used to come through a single channel which was our Experiment Managment team. Earlier the process was tedious and was hard to get 
direct customer feedback which in turn caused slower tool improvements. 
I identified that gap and built a feedback feature in UI of the tool, which would stick to the side of the page and end customer could click 
on it anytime to open up a modal , select the type of feedback ( Bug, Enhancement, Review ), enter text and click submit. This feedback would 
directly go to a Slack channel which was monitored by the on-call person and he/she could now create a ticket for the same. Eventually this 
feature came to be most effective when we lost the support of the Experiment Management team when the team had to be dissolved.

Q. Tell me about a time you had a disagreement or conflict with a manager or coworker? What was it about. How did you respond in the moment. 
How did it resolve?
Ans. This happened recently where I had an disagrement with a coworker over an implemented feature in the UI. In the UI we displayed a piece of 
information which was causing confusion to certain customers and my coworker had to deal with it. He was being pinged by couple of customers and 
he had to explain that it was not the real issue that they were facing. Hence he reached out to me and was adamant about removing it altogether 
and in my opinion we could not remove it. My first reactiong was to understand his reasoning completely before responding. Once I understood his 
reasoning I brought up my point that we should make an informed decision before coming to a conclusion. I reached out to our TPM and asked him if 
the information was critical to any set of users ? He said all the seasoned users need this information to be presented in the UI and it was not 
a great idea to not show it. After some further communication with the confused customers I found out that they were new customers and lacked 
training in specifics. Hence to fit both the usecases, we muted the information so that its there but not highlighted and also added a helper doc 
link to explain little bit more about it. Hence my coworker was happy about the solution and so were the customers.

Q. Tell me about a time you failed? Could be failed to meet a sprint timeline?
Ans. I failed to meet a sprint timeline for a feature I was owning. The feature involved work both on backend services and frontend. 
The UI was depended on the service work to be finished. I did not communcate this well to my teammate and he started the services work in the 
second week of the sprint which left me with very little time to finish the UI implementation and complete end-to-end testing of the feature. 
Had I communicated well he could have started to work on that first and I would have had enough time to implement and test the feature in the UI.

Q. Why do you want to leave WM?
Ans. I am Seeking new challenges/opportunities to gain more knowledge in the industry of working in different domains and teams. Plus I also want to
experience a new environment given the fact that I have been in Walmart for close to 4.5 - 5 years.

============================================================================================================================================

Q. Why do you want to join SN?
Ans. Well there are couple of reasons why I want to join Service Now 
- First I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to an exciting/forward-thinking/fast-moving company whose SaaS solutions are widely 
used across the industry. 
- Secondly the work environment. I spoke to couple of ex-collegues of mine who are now working at Service Now and they told me about how 
excited and happy they are to work in their respective teams. So if multiple team feedbacks are the same, then that speaks about how good 
the company culture is. Hence I would be excited to join Service Now and your team. 

============================================================================================================================================

Q. What are your biggest pain points day-to-day at WM?
Ans. I think one of the biggest pain point in my current role is attending meetings which arent too much relevant and I believe I could avoid some. 
Plus being a developer I would want to have a balance of writing code and attending meetings. If asked for example := being invited to 2 standups ,
one for the tool and one of the wider team everyday for an hour. Joining pre-planning meetings for other teams)

============================================================================================================================================

Q. what is your goal if you join in the first 1month, 3months, 6months after joining?
Ans. In the initial couple of weeks I would like to consume and obsorbe as much knowledge as I can that is key to my role and understand how 
the team works and its processses while getting the hang of the code and contributing.

First month I would like to get better understanding of teamâ€™s internal and external customers. Look for bottlenecks or blockers that need 
to be addressed for the work I am doing so that I can work independently without much input but keeping the communication going with you and 
other team members if I am blocked. Connecting with people better and understanding the product and the company.

3 months down the line I should have enough understanding that I can now start to closely watch our work, processes and try to identify any pain 
points or improvements where I can provide suggestions, make improvements and gain feedback. At this point I should be able to clearly able set 
my goals for the upcoming year. 

6 months down the line I think I should be comfortable leading some key features / projects and be an integral member of the team who is able to 
contribute in each aspect of the working of our team may it be process / code / or customer support. 

End of each month I would reflect on the improvements I made and blockers I have that need to be addressed.
