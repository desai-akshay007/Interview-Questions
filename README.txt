# Interview-Questions
Q. What is your biggest failure or regret?
Ans. When I had the chance I did not taking up working on backend services side of the application which was in Java. That would have helped to widen my knowledge and experince. This was when a coworker from the backend team had left and there was an opportunity for someone to step in and take the ownership of certain part of the backend services. Later someone else took the ownership and I regret passing up on the chance. Though later I onboarded with the backend services codebase and helped out with smaller tickets and code reviews. 

Q. Tell about an experience on a feature, or dealing with an issue? Explain the background, the trouble and how it resolved? Reflect on what your learned from it and how that changed your decides going forward?
Ans. 

Q. What is your greatest accomplishment?
Ans.

Q. Tell me about a time you had a disagreement or conflict with a manager or coworker? What was it about. How did you respond in the moment. How did it resolve?
Ans. This happened recently where I had an disagrement with a coworker over an implemented feature in the UI. In the UI we displayed a piece of information which was causing confusion to certain customers and my coworker had to deal with it. He was being pinged by couple of customers and he had to explain that it was not the real issue that they were facing. Hence he reached out to me and was adamant about removing it altogether. To which my reactiong was to understand his reasoning completely before responding. Once I understood his reasoning I brought up my point that we should make an informed decision before coming to a conclusion. I reached out to our TPM and asked him if the information was critical to any set of users ? He said all the seasoned users need this information to be presented in the UI and it was not a great idea to not show it. After some further communication with the customers I found out that they were new customers and lacked training in specifics. Hence to fit both the usecases, we muted the information so that its there but not highlighted and also added a helper doc link to explain little bit more about it. Hence my coworker was happy about the solution and so were the customers. 

Q. Tell me about a time you failed? Could be failed to meet a sprint timeline?
Ans. I failed to meet a sprint timeline for a feature I was owning. The feature involved work both on backend services and frontend. The UI was depended on the service work to be finished. I did not communcate this well to my teammate and he started the services work in the second week of the sprint which left me with very little time to finish the UI implementation and complete end-to-end testing of the feature. Had I communicated well he could have started to work on that first and I would have had enough time to implement and test the feature in the UI. 

Q. A gap you recognized in the tool/process and how your effort/innovation helped resolve the gap ?
Ans. Our tool did not have a proper user feedback mechanism or process in place. If a user notices a bug or wants an enhancement or wants us to know how imp a feature is there was no feedback loop. I created a small but effective feedback feature in the UI through which a user could instantly from the tool itself send a feedback ( bug , enhancement, review ) which would ping us directly in a slack channel. Based on the feedback the on-call engineer could now create a JIRA ticket. This feature helped to close the feedback loop.
